# Set Up Instructions

First, you must create a [github access token](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token#creating-a-token).

Then, clone this repo by running the following command in the terminal:
```
cd {directory/to/store/repo}
git clone https://github.com/ryanlattanzi/algo_trading
```
When prompted for username and password, paste the access token instead of the password. ([like here](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token#using-a-token-on-the-command-line))
